This is unsupervised learning project built using pytorch. Images from CIFAR10 dataset are modified by masking a 4 by 4 square in the middle and a convolutional neural network is trained by predicting the masked 4x4 square from modified image.\
After training network on gpu for 10 epochs it achieves smaller than 20 average absolute difference between pixels. Such network can reasonably well color in the masked pixels on unseen images.\
